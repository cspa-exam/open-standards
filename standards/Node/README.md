# The Node.js Open Standard

In this folder you will find a curated set of questions that every Node.js developer needs to know.

Key points to keep in mind:

- **THESE ARE NOT TRICK QUESTIONS.** They may seem nuanced, but they're exceedingly common. This is the level of detail you should expect to with with in your real-world day-to-day job.
- **This repo contains all the answers** â€“ it's primarily for question crafting. If you want to test yourself on this knowledge, you can take the self-paced exam at [CSPA.io](cspa.io) (coming soon).
- **These questions test fundamental Node.js**. We highly recommend first going through the [JavaScript open standard](../JavaScript/README.md).

And finally, this set does not test every single little aspect of Node. Instead, it intends to cover difficult but fundamental concepts, as well as common pitfalls of the environment.
