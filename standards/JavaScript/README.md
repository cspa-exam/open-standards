# The JavaScript Open Standard

In this folder you will find an industry-agreed upon set of questions that every JavaScript developer should know.

Key points to keep in mind:

- **THESE ARE NOT TRICK QUESTIONS.** They may seem nuanced, but they're exceedingly common. This is the level of detail you should expect to with with in your real-world day-to-day job.
- **This repo contains all the answers** – it's primarily for question crafting. If you want to test yourself on this knowledge, you can take the self-paced exam at [CSPA.io](cspa.io) (coming soon).
- **These questions test fundamental JavaScript**. Other areas – such as Node.js and the browser – will be more thoroughly covered in future standards.

And finally, this set does not test every single little aspect of JavaScript. Instead, it intends to cover difficult but fundamental concepts, as well as common pitfalls of the language.

**Minor Note**: Questions in parts 1-4 are all written in ES5. Newer langauge features are great; they are primarily covered in part 5.
